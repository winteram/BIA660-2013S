(Perhaps Congress realized how much free-floating authority the old version gave to the AG to condition grants.)

TEXT: I agree with Bruce as to the HHS view on religion and the SSA view on penalties for fraud. Apart from anything else, these are very weak constitutional claims. I also agree with Bruce as to insert A. We took this out because it seemed so weak as to discredit other arguments. I see no reason to put it back in. Insert B seems quite repetitive of the two paragraphs on p. 5. Is that insert supposed to replace those paragraphs? If not, it's not necessary. If so, it seems too brief to me (see my discussion with Steve and Bruce last week.) How about a compromise: delete the first paragraph on p.5; replace it with the first sentence of Insert B; then (in the same, rather than a new, pargaraph) replace the first sentence of the second paragraph with the statement "We doubt, however, that such an argument would succeed." And then, continue on'with the rest of that paragraph (starting with "First ... ").

TEXT: 1. On the length of the equal protection analysis, I still think we should go with the compromise I proposed. But I wouldn't be terribly upset if someone shortened that yet a little further. 2. On the "caste system" point, Steve has a good point. (You'll remember that I didn't defend this language; I just explained it -- and warned that DOJ‚àëmight well resist its removal.) As noted before, I'd be perfectly content -- e~en pleased -- to see this language go.

We had started to plan our first such meeting and had talked about it to Jack, Cheryl, Maggie, and Rahm. As some appointments are made (particularly to replace Deval), we thought we would add some agency people. And of course, we'd love participation from you or anyone else in the Chief of Staff's office. We think a regular meeting of this kind would contribute to fashioning a coordinated and strong policy (and message) on racial matters. Let me know what you think. Thanks.

TEXT: Yes but: It is very very unusual for the Justice Dept to decline to defend the constitutionality of a law. The standard is that the law must be "patently unconstitutional." I don't believe many (or any) of the legal immigrant provisions would meet that standard.	(When DOJ does decline to defend, it has not to notify Congress, so that Congress has an opportunity to join the suit.) So I agree that we' shouldn't go out of our way to criticize Chiles -- but we should understand that we're almost certainly going to be fighting him in court.

TEXT: Podesta says the President has expressed some skepticism about the new EEOC guidelines on accommodating workers with mental/psychological disabilities. Podesta says this is somewhat sensitive because Mrs. Gore has come out publicly in favor of the guidelines. Podesta suggested that we write a memo to him (not directly to the President) laying out the situation -- what the guidelines do, what the process was for issuing them, what is likely to happen now, and whatever else you think appropriate. Thanks much. By the way, in case you haven't dealt with the EEOC before, I've always found ellen vargas, the general counsel there, to be fairly helpful.

TEXT: In line with our discussion this morning, we should also think about whether further action on human research is warranted. Sen. Glenn has a bill applying the protections now used in federally funded or regulated research to ALL research. Elizabeth thinks this might be a good time to send that bill around for agency comment. And a recent NYT article on the subject suggested that some changes in requirements for institutional review boards might be in order.	(Apparently Shays just conducted a hearing on this issue and expressed some amazement about how easy it is for a researcher to shop for an IRB that will support her experiment.)

In response, her staff has asked whether we are interested in discussing other approaches or initiatives for supporting this group.	We have responded very positively: it would be great if we could do something else for her in this ~rea, rather than just reject her proposal.

And I think you have the themes exactly right: a deep-rooted belief in the dignity of every individual (as much a part of his personality as of his jurisprudence) and a commitment to the Constitution as a living charter of freedom. Perhaps the only thing I'd add is an unshakable determination to protect the underdog -- the people whom no one else will protect, etc.

He just won reelection by a very small margin after a campaign in which he took a lot of grief for his relationship with us. I recommend getting a decision on this issue now, without a meeting. We can have a decision memo for Erskine or anyone else this week. Agreed?

USDA should have the legislation ready by next Tuesday. Secretary Glickman (and perhaps the Vice President) will announce the new legislation next week. They will also call for full funding of our food safety initiative in the Agriculture appropriations bill; the current version of that bill is now about $4 million short of our request.

TEXT: I think B is by far the best in terms of message. Rather than requiring us to make a case about tobacco company profits generally, we would be saying only that tobacco companies shouldn't use the recent settlement as an opportunity to gouge consumers. It seems as if this option also best responds to Rubin's point about the sensitivity of the business community to excess profits taxes, since it's the most limited (i.e., tobacco-company-specific) in terms of rationale.

TEXT: I'm the biggest fan of RFRA (now RLPA) in this building, but you should not take this advice right now. You'll have a gay/lesbian firestorm on your hands.	(Alternatively, if you come out for a version of RFRA that has a civil rights carve-out, you'll have a religious groups firestorm on your hands.) We had a meeting with the religious groups yesterday and are having a meeting with the gay groups Monday to see whether we can work out some kind of rapprochment (sp?). We'll let 'you know as soon as it's safe to go back in the water. ---------------------- Forwarded by Elena Kagan/OPD/EOP on OS/20/99 02:53 PM ---------------------------

TO: James Castello
READ:17-JUL-1995 15:57:00.67
TEXT: After you left, George asked that a draft of the decision memo be circulated; after the meeting, he said that meant to Rasco, Rovlin, Griffin, and him. It seems to me that the way to go is to recommend that the President reject the bill because (1) it does not inlcude an exception for the health of the mother, and (2) (not stressed as much) because it may apply to abortions that are done prior to the last trimester and prior to viability. It sounds as if what George wants is for the President to take an up-front position that if narrowed in these two ways, he would support it. (We should make clear because George didn't seem to understand it, that such a bill would prevent abortions in cases of fetal deformity.) As we've discussed, I think it would be hard to argue that such a position is unconstitutional (i.e., I think OLC's third argument is weak). The question that the participants in the meeting didn't realy focus on is: what happens if the health exception is included, but the bill continues to apply to pre-viability as well as post-viability abortions? As a legal matter, the question here has to do with whether this an undue burden. A certain answer to this question would require lots of facts we don't know, having to do with the circumstances in which this procedure could (or could not) be replaced by other procedures; my hunch, though, is that the undue burden argument would be a stretch.

TEXT: Sorry I didn't get back to you; I was at the Waco hearing all day (and night). I actually think the old. paragraph was better. Here's why. (1) Even under Roe, I do not think courts would have automatically equated fetal deformities with harm to maternal health. (2) The Schroeder bill also does not equate the two. It seems to apply only when fetal deformity itself endangers women's health; perhaps there is a presumption that this will always be the case, but this presumption is not spelled out. (3) Related to the above but more generally, I think in this paragraph you equate the two too much. For some women, all fetal deformities will pose a threat to maternal health; for other women, some will;

TEXT: Late in the day, BD lawyer Evans, in response to a question by McCullum, noted Jahn's testimony that certain tapes reveal that the BDs were spreading fuel and preparing to set a fire as the gas was coming in. Evans said Jahn's description of the tapes was accurate and then asked why the FBI agents on the scene didn't hear the same thing (and if they did hear it, why they didn't react to it). I had never heard this criticism before. Unless this is a wholly absurd line of attack (and maybe even if it is), I wouldn't be surprised if some Republicans pick up on this in the next few days.

TEXT: A quick summary of yesterday's late night session. The two made the case that Koresh was coming out soon, that a major occurred on the 14th, etc. This testimony fit with the two earlier in the day, and allowed Republicans to press the case that if only the FBI had waited, all would have ended well. The implication was that people in Washington (exactly who was never made clear) made the decision to go forward without knowing what those closer to the situation knew: that a corner had been turned in the negotiations with Koresh. The questioning of the Rangers was uneventful. They effectively defused the controversy surrounding their conversations with Noble, in part by pointing out that they had equally detailed conversations with Republican staff members, in part by looking incorruptible. They criticized some aspects of the operation and 'supported others; in general, no one got very much out of them. All the members participated in a kind of contest as to who could suck up to them (the Rangers) more. MOST IMPORTANT: At one point, out of the blue, Buyer stated the following theory: In April 1993, a new administration was going through some rough times

That section talks a lot about how the order promotes health and safety and improves the environment, all of which is very nice but legally irrelevant (or at least incomplete). There's very little discussion of what there should be discussion of: how the order relates (whether through health and safety effects or otherwise) to the procurement process and the efficiency of governmental contracting. In addition, the enforcement mechanisms in the order raise some questions. But not to worry: we're on the case.

TEXT: FYI: Last week, Senator Domenici and Congressman Kasich requested Director Rivlin to provide Congress with the shutdown plans of all "Executive Branch agencies." Appearing before the Budget Committees this morning, Rivlin explained that the plans were not ready yet, but indicated that she would provide them soon. The White House plan did not specifically come up, and I suspect no one will press for it. (None of the charts and tables that Rivlin provided to Congress this morning listed the EOP, and no one commented on the exclusion.) But I suppose we should be prepared if Congress, upon recelvlng all the agency plans, asks for the EOP's as well. Let me know if you have any thoughts about what to do in this event.

TEXT: You might want to take a look at a cgse called Church of Latter Day Saints v. Amos. It's been a long time since I read it, but I believe the Court held that exempting a church from general Title VII requirements was permissible, even though the requirements did not interefere with free exercise. I don't remember the reasoning, but it at least suggests that there's some category of permissible exemptions of religious institutions from generally applicable laws beyond what's strictly speaking necessary to accommodate religious requirements.

TEXT: A few more thoughts: 1. On the need to prioritize: I agree with TJ that there should be more guidance for the field. It's true that if we win on k3, we're legally obligated to provide replacement timber for the whole 225 mbf. But we might lose on k3 -- and if we do, we will need to know which of these sales are the worst, which the next worst, and so on. TJ's right that the memo doesn't prioritiz.e in this way, nor does it suggest how the field folks should prioritize for themselves. 2. The memo suggests that we have no problem with any of the sales we already have been forced to release. Is that true? Or are there some previously released sales that we currently are -- or ought to be -- negotiating about? And if so, how do these sales fit within the (nonexistent) list of priorities. 3. The statement about needing twice as much alternative timber has to be deleted. Someday we may be in litigation with purchasers over whether timber we've given them is of like kind and value, and in that context, this statement will come back to haunt us. 4. To expand on the concerns raised by Dinah in her second and third bullitts, can't we cut back on a lot of this memo's statement of the problem? I'd be more comfortable if this memo didn't spend so much time characterizing our legal obligations. 5. I'm of mixed mind as to whether we should say so directly that we will exercise our right to cancel contracts if negotiations are unsuccessful. It might be helpful, from an internal point of view, to put this position on record. More, I doubt it will come as a surprise to the timber industry that we've been thinking about this option. Finally, we will need to state this position, at some point and in some context, if we want to use it as leverage. But I worry that the industry will attempt to use this memo's flat statement against us -- perhaps as a basis for immediately seeking a declaratory judgment regarding our contractual rights, or perhaps as evidence that the cancellations result from broadscale policy concerns, rather than from good faith case-by-case evaluation of the results of contractual performance. I think I would at least like to play with the language to alleviate my concerns on these matters.

Any legislation, however, must respect the important role of the states in our federal system and must fairly balance the interests of consumers with those of manufacturers and sellers. Congress could have passed legislation, appropriately limited in scope and balanced in application, meeting these tests. The President would have been glad to sign such a bill.

TEXT: How about something like this: As you all know, the President vetoed the Product Liability Reform Act last week. The President supports the enactment of product liability reform, but such reform must be appropriately limited in scope and balanced in application. ~he President could not sign the bill that Congress sent him because it failed to meet these standards. Most generally, the President disapproved of the bill's "one-way preemption" the way the bill would have displaced state law that was more favorable to consumexs, but deferred to state law that was less so. The President also opposed, as he stated many times throughout the legislative process, the complete elimination of joint liability for noneconomic damages and the capping of punitive damages. He believes that these provisions would have undermined the ability of courts to provide appropriate relief to victims of defective products and thereby endangered the health and safety of the public. Finally, the President was very disappointed that the Conference moved backward in certain respects from the Senate version of the bill -- first, in widening the application and shortening the length of the statute of repose and second, in applying the bill's limits on damages to "negligent entrustment" suits

TEXT: And another thought: We could stress that this directive is needed in order to allow states the time to devise fair and accurate ways of making the determinations required by the bill. The bill does allow certain legal aliens to receive food stamps -- for example, if they're veterans or if theY're permanent resident aliens who have worked for 40 quarters. Right now, the states don't have ways of checking such information and making eligibility determinations on that basis. So when Mr. X comes up for certification tomorrow, the state may well make a mistake in determining his eligibility. This directive will go some way toward giving states the time they need to set up verification procedures that will ensure accurate eligibility determinations.

TEXT: I think part of the way to talk about the certification date directive is to use the situation of a person who already has applied for citizenship. Assumehis certification date is coming up; he will be cut off from benefits even though he's just waiting for INS to process his application.' The effect of this directive could be (as we discussed, we cannot say "would be") to provide him with benefits for the few months he needs to become naturalized. Of course, the directive also applies to aliens who have not applied for or are currently ineligible for naturalization. But those cases are of course less sympathetic. Moreover, in those cases the directive only postpones the inevitable cut-off, whereas in the "immigration pipeline" case discussed above, it serves a real transitional function.

SUBJECT: residency requirement -- fyi
TO: Bruce N. Reed
READ: 9-SEP-1996 10:11:50.00
TEXT: 1. Just to clarify: the two provisions relating to new residents are at 402(a) (1) (B) (i) and 404(c). The former, if taken alone, would suggest that Wisconisn does not need a waiver to implement its proposed 60-day waiting period; the latter, if taken alone, would suggest that Wisconsin does need a waiver to take this action. It is unclear what the answer should be given that both these provisions -- 402 seeming to countenance any differential treatment of new residents, 404 seeming to countenance only one kind (and not Wisconsin's kind) of differential treatment -- are in the statute. HHS of course takes the position that 404 is the controlling provision -- hence that Wisconsin needs a waiver. I am proceeding on the assumption that you don't want to contest this interpretation. 2. Anna Durand and I spoke late Friday afternoon. She told me that Mary Jo didn't want to agree to the language she (Anna) had proposed on the residency requirement. I told her that Jack has always had strong feelings on this issue, and there is no reason to think he will change them: he wants HHS to approve the waiver on this issue in exactly the way we proposed months ago. I also noted that we should just do the thing rather than write a letter saying we would be doing it sometime. She didn't disagree, but she's clearly not calling the shots here: she was going to go back to Mary Jo and call me on Monday.

TEXT: As I told you yesterday, our office is setting up a meeting for later in the day to discuss all the California alternatives and try to reach (finally) a resolution. The last page of the Greenstein memo talks about CA's timing problems. It sounds as if they need this morning either (1) a decision to grant CA's request or (2) a USDA commitment that quality control errors resulting from our consideration 0 o f this request be excused for good cause. Since we can't have the first this morning, I think we should try to do the second. Can you call folks at USDA and ask them to make this commitment? I'll call you this morning if I can.

TEXT: The striking thing about Cohen's column is that while he criticizes the President sharply, his position and the President's are very much consistent with each other. As you say, the President has said he would prohibit the use of this procedure where not necessary to save the woman from death or serious physical injury. The only thing he has asked for is a tightly confined exception for these kinds of cases. (Nor, by the way, has the President made any representations about how many late-term or partial birth abortions are done for life/serious health reasons and how many for other reasons. He hasn't said that all partial birth abortions are done for life/health reasons -- indeed, he has acknowledged that not all are. He has said only that those done for life/serious health reasons must be permitted.) I guess I'm agnostic as between a call and a letter. I lean towards the call, but mostly I think that the two of you should decide. If we decide on a letter, I'd be happy to draft or to review. If we decide on a call, I'd be happy to participate as needed.

I suspect they will make some changes along these lines, though not to the extent we would like. I also urged Seth to change the language in the brief's conclusion. Right now it says the Court should grant cert "if the Court agrees that this is an appropriate case" to reconsider Aguilar. I asked that the conclusion state that the Court should grant cert "because this is an appropriate case" to reconsider Aguilar, which is a phrase used elsewhere in the brief. We shall see. 2.

TEXT: 1. Victor Schwartz called to tell me he was sending us another memo on products reform -- this one dealing more with politics, and less with substance. During our conversation, he proposed that Jack convene a meeting that both he (Schwartz) and the new President of ATLA would attend -- presumably to see if there is any common ground. I don't see any reason to do this right now, but it is something to keep in mind.

TEXT: As I told Jack on Friday, DOJ definitely wants to seek cert in this case. The 8G's Office says that it always seeks cert when lower courts have held a statute unconstitutional; in essence, the Office uses the same standard in determining whether to seek cert as it does in deciding whether to defend the statute initially. The NEA is obviously unhappy with proceeding any further; it is worried that the decision to seek cert will deeply offend the arts community, which then will refuse to support the agency in future congressional battles over funding. But given the SG's general policy, combined with the broader politics of this issue, I don't see any way to support the NEA in its effort to stop DOJ from going further. I anyone disagrees, let me know.

TEXT: Jane Lay of OGE is going to call you (Jack) -- or may already have done so. I think she will try to persuade you to abandon the idea of extending the executive order prohibiting earned outside income to all political appontees. Per your last note, I asked Beth Nolan and Jane to prepare the language amending the EO (and the accompanying OGE regs) in this way. I take it that Jane wants to make a last stab at changing your mind before she gives us the language.	(Recall that we are acceding to her yiew that a ban on all earned income is better than a ban on honoraria alone; but she would prefer that we take neither action.)

TEXT: Steve Kelman. Marvin Krislov, and I met yesterday to discuss: 1. Governmental policy on reimbursement of costs incurred in "anti-union" activities; and 2. Governmental policy on contracting with frequent labor law violators I thought it was a pretty good meeting. Kelman seemed very receptive to preventing reimbursement of anti-union costs, either under existing law or by issuing new regulations. He was much less receptive -- but not entirely closed-minded -- as to discouraging agencies from contracting at all with frequent labor law violators. He wants to speak with his own staff and to some contracting officials about possible approaches on both of these issues. He will report back to Marvin and Kathy (since I'll be gone) with options.

TEXT: I disagree with the first. As to the second, we're not far away from an almost certainly adverse decision on CDA, so we should definitely make plans now. Also, I think it seems kind of defensive, rather than positive and affirmative to do it in that context, so I think it's fine that the President said what he said. But you needn't argue this with Gips. All

TEXT: The meeting was fine -- not great, not bad. It focused on fairly short-term things -- in particular, on whether the AMA policy can be reversed at its convention on June 23. We agreed to do a bit of thinking about whether we (in truth, HHS) could contribute to that effort. Chuck and I are meeting with the AG on Tuesday; Donna offered to send over some doctors this week (though we don't know who or when) to give a medical briefing. I think we all could use a briefing from the legislative people, but I lean toward asking for this at one of the morning meetings, rather than calling a separate meeting for the purpose.

He just won reelection by a very small margin after a campaign in which he took a lot of grief for his relationship with us. I recommend getting a decision on this issue now, without a meeting. We can have a decision memo for Erskine or anyone else this week. Agreed?

TEXT: Food Safety -- As noted in the DPC weekly, USDA is currently working on food safety legislation that would give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to recall contaminated food and to assess civil penalties for noncompliance with safety standards. USDA should have the legislation ready by next Tuesday. Secretary Glickman (and perhaps the Vice President) will announce the new legislation next week. They will also call for full funding of our food safety initiative in the Agriculture appropriations bill; the current version of that bill is now about $4 million short of our request.

TEXT: I expect you're going to get a call from Bob Rubin suggesting that you hold regular meetings on tobacco in which Larry Summers cah participate. Rubin's essential complaint seems to be that we rely on Treasury people for lots of work, but don't bring them in to top-level decisionmaking. Of course, Bruce does have weekly tobacco meetings to which Larry is invited, and Treasury people are allover the various tobacco policy processes; we also will begin to include their legislative people (Linda Robertson or Marty Thomas) in the daily phone calls we have with HHS's legislative office..What Rubin seems to feel is missing is the opportunity to sit around your table on questions of strategy, as in the budget process. I guess this would mean fairly regular meetings with you, Bruce, Larry Stein, Larry Summers, Donna (plus one staff?), Frank/Jack/Josh, Bruce Lindsey, Ron, and perhaps someone from Justice.

TEXT: We continued our discussions today with Senators McCain and Hollings, and believe we now have the outlines of an agreement; over the next few days, we will work with McCain's and Hollings' staff to incorporate it in a manager's amendment. As we described yesterday, we have improved the bill in key areas: strengthened lookback penalties, a tougher ETS provision, a higher liability cap and the elimination of other liability protections, and a narrowed antitrust exemption. Notwithstanding these improvements, some Senators have objected to our anticipated agreement with McCain, arguing that it will undermine their ability to pass strengthening amendments on the floor. Erskine spoke to the Caucus today and explained that we wanted to strengthen the bill as much as we could before it gets to the floor, given the fairly low probability of passing Democratic amendments there.

READ: 4-AUG-1995 08:44:27.58
TEXT: FYI: This executive order needs a fair bit of work. The biggest problem is that there isn't right now a legally sufficient basis for the order stated in the introductory section. That section talks a lot about how the order promotes health and safety and improves the environment, all of which is very nice but legally irrelevant (or at least incomplete). There's very little discussion of what there should be discussion of: how the order relates (whether through health and safety effects or otherwise) to the procurement process and the efficiency of governmental contracting. In addition, the enforcement mechanisms in the order raise some questions. But not to worry: we're on the case.
